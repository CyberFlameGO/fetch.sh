## Contributing:
Push test scripts here that you would like to implement but are off-base of the main goals of fetch,sh, which is to print as much Linux/BSD system information as possible while keeping the code base tiny and portable. The scripts here need to be tested on more than one type of operating system to be pushed to alpha branch.
